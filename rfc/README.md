# Exodus RFCs

Many changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements can be
implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow.

Some changes though are "substantial", and we ask that these be put through a
bit of a design process and produce a consensus among the Exodus community and
the development team.

The "RFC" (request for comments) process is intended to provide a consistent and
controlled path for new features to enter the game, so that all stakeholders can
be confident about the direction the game is evolving in.
